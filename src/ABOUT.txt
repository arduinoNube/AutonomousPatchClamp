* ABOUT AUTOPATCH4 *

Autopatch4 is the code to control the autoswapper and the autopatcher in c++.

It consists of 3 threads:
    1. Thor motor thread
    2. Mbed worker thread
    3. DAQ worker thread
    4. Main GUI thread

All the threads are started in the main GUI thread and then the worker objects
are moved to those new threads.  They are connected to the main GUI thread using
a series of signals and slots.  The most notable of which are the dataReady
signal from the DAQ worker that updates the plots and records a resistance
measurement.

The Autopatcher runs in the mainwindow.cpp file in the GUI thread.  The
Autoswapper is mainly run in the Thor motor thread since while it's swapping it
doesn't really need to interact with the Autopatcher or the main GUI.  It's kind
of self contained in that way.  The Thor motor thread must also respond to the
Autopatcher signals but it doesn't require a huge amount of functionality and is
only minimally implemented.

The DAQ thread on the other hand is very intertwined with the autopatcher algorithm.
