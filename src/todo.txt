1. Add "recording time" log variable
2. Back up 20 um after descent
3. Allow resistance drops after descent as long as it's not broken
4. No cell detections allowed in the first 20 microns (items 2 and 3 may obviate this item)
5. Pressure pulses & position adjustments to improve Ra
6. High frequency pulses (70-200 Hz) for BAC firing.
7. "BAD PIPETTES" due to bubbles, clogs, or already being inserted into the tissue
8. Automated I-V curve processing
9. Reduce the number of current injections required to get the IV curve and do cell QC.
10. FIX THE ACCESS RESISTANCE CALCULATION

Future:
- Add trial note taking app in GUI to mention bleeding, which craniotomy was used, etc.
- Pipette length measurement
- On-line craniotomy monitoring and saline addition

I probably shouldn't have the wait state controlling this state (quickAPDetect) since they're supposed to be independent,
but I need a readable, global state switching function that is easily defined and human readable.  I'd
prefer it not to be dynamic but I may have to go that way.
