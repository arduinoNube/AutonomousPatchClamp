This design document delineates the scope and transitions between states

1. HardwareInit -> GetPipette or Error

This state initializes all the hardware connections (COM ports, ActiveX
containers, dll intefaces, etc.) so they are ready to be used by all subsequent
states.  Specifically, this means:

COM ports are opened (Autopatcher, filler, SCARA, headstage clamp)
ActiveX Containers are initialized and running (ThorLabs motor)
DLL calls have been confirmed working (multiclamp)
DAQ Is initialized and has run a self-check (not tasks have been created)

If all the initializations succeed, the state proceeds to the "GetPipette" state
If any of these initializations fail, the state proceeds to the "Error" state

2. GetPipette -> SetBrainHeight or PipetteQC

This state operates the SCARA robot to aquire a pipette.  It then switches to
either the SetBrainHeight state or the PipetteQC state.  The SetBrainHeight
state is selected the fisrt time the code is run or whenever a check box is set
manually indicating that they'd like to reset the brain height the next time the
pipette is changed.  If something goes wrong, it switches to the "Error" state.

3. SetBrainHeight -> PipetteQC or Error

This state sets the height of the surface of the brain either manually or
automatically.  After it is complete, the pipette should be 20-30 microns above
the surface of the brain submerged in ACSF.

4. PipetteQC -> ClogCheck or Retract or Error

This state checks the resistance of the pipette and if it passes inspection,
lowers the pipette to the depth of interest in the brain and then switches to
the "ClogCheck" state.  If not, it switches to the Retract" state.

5. ClogCheck -> NeuronHunt or Error

This state
